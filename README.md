# Habot Web Application

This repository contains the solution for the **Habot assessment task**, where I built a responsive web application using **React** and styled it with **Tailwind CSS**. The project features a modern UI with a sticky navbar, login/signup modals, and dynamic user interaction using React Context API.

## Features

- **Responsive UI**: Fully responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Sticky Navbar**: A fixed navigation bar that remains visible as you scroll down the page.
- **Authentication Modals**: Login and Signup modals are displayed dynamically using React Context API.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Beautiful and customizable design built with Tailwind CSS.
